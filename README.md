# Natural-Gas-Price-Pattern-Recognition-ARIMA-model-Seasonal-Decompose

#### Summary
- Initially I started with understanding the dataset and all related parameters inside.
- Multiple visualizations from different perspectives helped discovering patterns(12 months(lag=12) high auto-correlation found).
- A mathematical proof to visual patterns found was undertaken.
- Utilized ARIMA model to forecast next 12 months data points.
- Utlized interpolation function combined with extrapolation to estimate prices of any date.
